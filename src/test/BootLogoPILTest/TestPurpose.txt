The purppose of this test is to:
1) Check if an image flipped horizontally in Photoshop is the same as one flipped in PIL
2) Check if once the byte removals are done on the flipped Photoshop and flipped PIL image they are the same
3) Verify that the size checks are not needed (i.e that PIL prodoces 
4) Verify that the result of doing the edits manually is the same as automatically doing them
